Emotion Detection in any form of text is essentially a content - based classification problem involving concepts from the domains of Natural Language Processing. A sufficient amount of analysis of emotions detected from facial and audio information has been done whereas interpreting emotions from textual data is still a fresh and hot area for comprehending human feelings.
